# VISIT THIS APP ON VERCEL: https://spot-weld.vercel.app/

I've creaated this app using the spotify api to search for artists, select one of their albums, and write a review/score with said album (with an ability to also choose a favourite track from the album).
You can then save the album and review.
At the moment, thats the extent of the functionality, but I aspire to make it a fully fledged social media, with each user having the abilty to save their own album reviews to their page, and view others reviews.
Another of my projects (a social media) can be found here: https://github.com/myles-hash/mySocialNetwork/tree/main/myles-soc-net
A combination of the two would achieve this.
